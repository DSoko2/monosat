Monosat.jar is a no-frills, low-level Java interface to the MonoSAT C API, generated using [JNAerator
](https://github.com/nativelibs4java/JNAerator). It was tested with JNA version 3.4, on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04, x64), but is otherwise completely unsupported. Use at your own risk! 

To generate Monosat.jar from scratch, build libmonosat.so, install JNAerator (or place jnaerator.jar in this folder), and run buildJNA.sh
